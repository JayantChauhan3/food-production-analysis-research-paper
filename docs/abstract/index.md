# Abstract

Food and nutrition security are closely related since only a food-based strategy can aid in eradicating malnutrition in a way that is both socially and economically viable. Since food production is a major factor in determining food availability, it serves as the foundation for food security. In order to analyze food production and consumption, this study discusses several elements of production corresponding to the population.

The foundation of food security is food production. The Rome Declaration on World Food Security, published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) in 1996, and its subsequent State of Food Insecurity in the World, published in 2001, serve as the generally recognised definitions of food security. When everyone, at all times, has physical, social, and economic access to enough, secure, and nutritious food that satisfies their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life, this is referred to as a condition of "food security."

Keywords: Accessibility, Access, and Absorption.

Accessability: The physical accessibility of food stocks in the appropriate quantities is referred to in clause I Food grain availability is determined by domestic production net of feed, seed, and wastage as well as net imports as well as draw-down of inventories, which is appropriate considering that food grains make up a significant portion of dietary consumption. Physical accessibility in any area of a country is reliant on market integration, storage and transportation facilities, and those facilities themselves.

Access: The package of entitlements, which includes people's initial endowments, what they can acquire (particularly in terms of physical and economic access to food), and the opportunities available to them to achieve entitlement sets with enough food either through their own efforts or through State intervention or both, determine access.

Absorption: The capacity to biologically utilise the food consumed is referred to as absorption. This in turn is significantly tied to the accessibility of clean water for drinking, sanitation, a hygienic environment, primary healthcare, as well as nutritional understanding and proper practises.
