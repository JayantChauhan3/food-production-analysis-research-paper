<h3  align="center">As in the above graph, the population of india in the year 2019 is 1.36 billion.</h3>
<p>According to Dieticians: </p>
<p>-100 grams of RICE/daily, 36 KG/annum</p>
<p>-250 grams of WHEAT/daily, 90 KG/annum</p>
<p>-50 grams of RICE/daily, 18 KG/annum</p>
<p>is considered for a healthy diet.</p>

<h3  align="center">In the above graph, 190 million tonnes of RICE, paddy is produced in the year 2019.</h3>
<p>-After analysing the amount of rice available per person is 190 million tonnes of rice divided by 1.36 billion people, comes down to 382 grams/daily(approx).</p>
<p>-Rice is produced surplus india by 200%.</p>
