</p>
<h3  align="center">As in the above graph, the population of india in the year 2019 is 1.36 billion.</h3>
<p>According to Dieticians: </p>
<p>-100 grams of RICE/daily, 36 KG/annum</p>
<p>-250 grams of WHEAT/daily, 90 KG/annum</p>
<p>-50 grams of CEREAL/daily, 18 KG/annum</p>
<p>is considered for a healthy diet.</p>
